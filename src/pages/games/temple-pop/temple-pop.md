### Description

Aim, shoot and match orbs in a mysterious ancient temple. Launch traps to clear the board faster. Features 4 game modes including a challenge mode!

### Note

This is one of my favorite games. It was designed and built in two weeks, art and code. At the time (2012), I felt I didn't have a lot to show for the many years I've spent working on games, so I wanted to build something that showcased my talent, and in the end, I got a beautiful game with art, music and sound all coming together very well.
